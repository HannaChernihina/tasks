3. Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array. Go to the editor
Test Data :
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2]));
console.log(first([],3));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],3));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],6));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],-3));
Expected Output :
7
[]
[7, 9, 0]
[7, 9, 0, -2]
[]

4. Write a JavaScript function to get the last element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the last 'n' elements of the array. Go to the editor
Test Data :
console.log(last([7, 9, 0, -2]));
console.log(last([7, 9, 0, -2],3));
